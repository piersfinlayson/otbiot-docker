Scripts to create otbiot/mosquitto-clients image.  Contains mosquitto_sub and mosquitto_pub MQTT clients.

Creating FROM image
===================

Go to ../alpine and create the otbiot/alpine image.

Creating image
==============

On a machine with the required architecture run:

  docker build -t otbiot/mosquitto-clients-<architecture> .

<architecture> should be one of:
- x86_64
- armhf

Once created push the image to dockerhub:

  docker push otbiot/mosquitto-clients-<architecture>

Creating architecture independent build image
=============================================

Once both architecture build images have been created, upload the architecture independent (manifest) to dockerhub.

  manifest-tool --docker-cfg '/home/USER/.docker/' push from-spec ./mosquitto-clients.yaml

Replace USER with the user's name.  You need to be logged in with docker first.

Using image
===========

docker run --rm -ti otbiot/mosquitto_clients mosquitto_sub -h 1.1.1.1 -t #
docker run --rm -ti otbiot/mosquitto_clients mosquitto_pub -h 1.1.1.1 -t /otb-iot/all -m trigger/ping
