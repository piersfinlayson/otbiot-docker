Builds a docker manifest for a dual architecture alpine image, used by:
- otbiot/missing-link
- otbiot/mosquitto-clients

Support architectures are:
- amd64/x86_64
- arm/armhf (Raspberry pi)

Creating manifest
=================

To create the from image you need to install manifest-tool: https://github.com/estesp/manifest-tool.  It is problematic to install and run on the Raspberry pi, so it is recommended to build otbiot/alpine on an x86_64 architecture.  (The issue seems to be that a golang container is not easily available for the rpi.)

Once manifest-tool is installed otbiot/alpine is created by running:

  manifest-tool --docker-cfg '/home/USER/.docker/' push from-spec ./alpine.yaml

Replace USER with the user's name.  This pushes the from image (manifest) to dockerhub.  You need to be logged in with docker first.
