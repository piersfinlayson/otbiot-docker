Container with "missing-link" scripts - that collect information from otb-iot devices via MQTT and dumps that information into an influxdb database.

Creating FROM image
===================

Go to ../alpine and create the otbiot/alpine image.

Creating individual build image
==============================

On a machine with the required architecture run:

  docker build -t otbiot/missing-link-<architecture> .

<architecture> should be one of:
- x86_64
- armhf

Once created push the image to dockerhub:

  docker push otbiot/missing-link-<architecture>

Creating architecture independent build image
=============================================

Once both architecture build images have been created, upload the architecture independent (manifest) to dockerhub.

  manifest-tool --docker-cfg '/home/USER/.docker/' push from-spec ./missing-link.yaml

Replace USER with the user's name.  You need to be logged in with docker first.

Using image
===========

docker run --rm -ti otbiot/missing-link
cd /scripts/
edit rssi.py:
- chipid (12 byte mac address or serial number of otb-iot device)
- influxdb_host
- mqtt_host
./rssi.py
