Creating FROM image
===================

otbiot/esp8266-build images for different architectures are built from the same (Debian/Ubuntu) based Dockerfile and image.  However, for different architectures different from images are used - on x86_64 Ubuntu is used, and on armhf Raspbian is used.  To avoid the need for different Dockerfiles for these architectures a single architecture independent from image is created - otbiot/esp8266-build-from.

Today two architectures are supported:
- amd64/x86_64
- arm/armhf (rpi)

To create the from image you need to install manifest-tool: https://github.com/estesp/manifest-tool.  It is problematic to install and run on the Raspberry pi, so it is recommended to build otbiot/esp8266-build-from on an x86_64 architecture.  (The issue seems to be that a golang container is not easily available for the rpi.)

Once manifest-tool is installed otbiot/esp8266-build-from is created by running:

  manifest-tool --docker-cfg '/home/USER/.docker/' push from-spec ./esp8266-build-from.yaml

Replace USER with the user's name.  This pushes the from image (manifest) to dockerhub.  You need to be logged in with docker first.

Creating individual build image
==============================

On a machine with the required architecture run:

  docker build -t otbiot/esp8266-build-<architecture> .

<architecture> should be one of:
- x86_64
- armhf

Once created push the image to dockerhub:

  docker push otbiot/esp8266-build-<architecture>

Creating architecture independent build image
=============================================

Once both architecture build images have been created, upload the architecture independent (manifest) to dockerhub.

  manifest-tool --docker-cfg '/home/USER/.docker/' push from-spec ./esp8266-build.yaml

Replace USER with the user's name.  You need to be logged in with docker first.
