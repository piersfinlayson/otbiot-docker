The Easy Way
============

On x86-64 and on both an ARMv6 and ARMv7 Pi run:

./build-container.sh VERSION_NUM

where VERSION_NUM is e.g. 0.2.2

The architecture is automatically detected

Once the scripts have completed (including pushing of the new images) on ALL machines run:

./build-manifest.sh

Then on one machine:

git add VERSION
git commit -m "Updated version number"
git push
